# Twitter
My Twitter project is a web application that emulates the basic functionality of Twitter using the Twitter API.  The project uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the backend, and the Twitter API and Passport.js for authentication.

Users can sign in with their Twitter accounts and view their home timeline, search for tweets and users, post tweets, and view user profiles.
